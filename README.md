This project implements a client to connect and invoke some methods on a server running a SOAP web service, here yuo can find the server repository: ([introsde-assignment-3](https://github.com/sn1p3r46/introsde-2015-assignment-3)).

This client is developed to perform the requests on the server project. All the client server interactions make use of the [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)  ([w3c](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_soap.asp)) protocol.

## Requirements:
`Apache Ant, OpenJDK, JRE and an Internet Connection;`

## Package Structure:

The project is divided into 3 packages. Each package contains:

`introsde.introsde.client`: The client program which connects to the Web Service.([link](https://github.com/sn1p3r46/introsde-2015-assignment-3-client/tree/master/src/introsde/client))

`introsde.introsde.handlers`: It contains static variables and a function, it is responsible of the pretty printing of the output. ([link](https://github.com/sn1p3r46/introsde-2015-assignment-3-client/tree/master/src/introsde/handlers))

`introsde.introsde.ws`: The classes generated by `wsimport` command, this package contains all the models and the functions that are needed to perform a correct communication between client and server. ([link](https://github.com/sn1p3r46/introsde-2015-assignment-3-client/tree/master/src/introsde/ws))

## Files included

The project contains some additional files.

`Client_logs.log`: is the output of the client when I ran it before pushing. (proof that it worked once :D)

## Execution

This project contains a `build.xml` file which can be run by `ant`. It will download `Apache Ivy`, this latter component will download all required dependencies from the [Maven repository](http://search.maven.org/).

To execute the client run:
```
ant start
```

This will install the missing dependencies, compile, and execute the program. The output will be save to `client.log`.

`PLEASE:  If you are running the server locally MIND to change the server address and launch the server application and before running the client`

The URI of the server is hard coded in `src/introsde/ws/HealthServiceImplementationService.java` file.
